## My process

2) <div> for each comment and a common box for all of them.
3) grid layout through grid-template-areas.
4) background-color and paddings for the common box.
5) background-color and border-radius for comment boxes.
6) distribution of the text between headings and paragraphs. font-size for the entire body.
7) images are added and made round.
8) flexbox for the info about authors (in order to place the name and the status on the right side).
9) font-family, font-weights for headings, different colors for clear and dark sections, and alteration to the opacity of paragraphs.
10) added the image of quotations.
    changed its position to absolute and the position of the 1st comment box to relative.
    placed the image at the proper place.
    changed its z-index to the value "1".
    changed the position of h2 to relative, than z-index of h2 to the value "2".
11) media query for the mobile design.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- hierarchical selectors
- media queries


### What I learned

I built my first Grid layout and revised Flexbox.

Finally, I made it clear how to combine selectors and what is the difference between hierarchical and combined ones.

Also solidified my knowledge of positioning and z-index.


### Continued development

Keep diving into Grid layout (use of named lines).
Multi-columns layout.
